Lighthouse Labs Rails Project

Mango
(my take on the Rotten Mangos assignment)

Time: 5 days

I turned it into a personal online movie club database.
My first time experimenting with front-end code and rails in length.
Played around with Javascript and animations with CSS.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
